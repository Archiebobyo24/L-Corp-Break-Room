		<description>
			<p>An unassuming human pounces in the night, his blade and revolver at the ready. A gunshot, followed by the sound of metal against flesh, and the splattering of blood over cobblestone. He snickers before plunging his blade anew into his battered prey.</p>
			<p>An elegant manikin vaults atop a maddened monster, before putting the barrel of her cannon against its skull, and pulling the trigger. She always loved explosions.</p>
			<p>Battleaxe in hand, a massive tiefling brutally decapitates a beast, then leaps towards another, plunging the silvered weapon in the creature’s chest and ripping a gashing wound from neck to groin. </p>
			<p>Jaegers are defined by their efficiency in battle, using their mastery over both steel and gunpowder to lay waste to all who oppose them. More than just soldiers, their skills represent the last wall of defense of a world fated to extinction; they are unstoppable and unbreakable. They strike fear in the heart of their foes, and bring hope to those they protect.</p>
			<h4>Engineered Perfection</h4>
			<p>In the ease and safety that contemporary advancements bring, city dwellers frequently forget how fortunate their lives are. They have all but forgotten the life of pain that would befall them if the system failed. Which is precisely what took place in Luyarnha.</p>
			<p>The urbanites were left defenseless when the scourge swept the streets of the city, snapping like twigs in the face of such ferocity. While the denizens of the town struggled against insurmountable odds, the church and the nobility didn’t remain inert, instead, concentrating their efforts to engineer the ideal weapon, something capable of annihilating the beasts plaguing the city. This weapon came to be known as the jaegers.</p>
			<p>Jaegers thrive in the savagery of the hunt. They are capable of superhuman feats; their reflexes more honed than that of mere mortals, they are capable of dodging the most vicious of blows, and using that momentum to plunge their blade deep into the heart of their prey. A jaeger’s thirst for battle is endless - only in inaction can they experience fatigue. They are the perfect weapon against the nightmarish tides of beasts, and the sole reason Luyarnha still stands.</p>
			<h4>Bonds of Blood</h4>
			<p>One who hunts beasts is a“hunter”, as they are commonly called by civilized society, but few hunters have the jaeger class. Bestowed powers beyond that of mere mortals, jaegers can come from any walk of life, having the appearance of any normal being, which allows them to blend in with crowds, only unleashing their abilities in times of need. They act as guardians for people who are unable to defend themselves, and they serve as the bloody sword of vengeance in a world that is hell-bent on destroying itself. Life in the city-state of Luyarnha is fraught with peril: gang warfare, infectious madness, and harrowing beasts. Amidst this chaos, jaegers are the first to charge into battle, so that their brothers and sisters can survive to live another day.</p>
			<p>Jaegers rarely leave their home city of Luyarnha - they would rather die than see it fall to the scourge. Following the jaeger's creed -'survive together, or die together'- they never hunt by themselves unless forced to. The nights can be brutal and the beasts are relentless; against such a ferocious onslaught, only a united front can hope to survive. As a result, jaegers are aware of the importance of teamwork and never charge into battle alone, save to retrieve fallen allies. The bonds formed during the hunts are stronger than those of many families. Blood is thicker than water, and the gods know that blood is shed when the hunt rages on.</p>
			<h4>Creating a Jaeger</h4>
			<p>Think about the nature of your abilities and what gave rise to them as you construct your jaeger character. Were you one of the numerous orphans whose bodies were experimented on in the jaeger research project? Did you voluntarily join the ranks of hunters, or were you abducted and brainwashed into the ideal soldier? Alternatively, you might have defied the established order and joined the jaegers by a different route - perhaps after finding an eldritch carving and engraving it on your flesh. You might be self-taught - a loner who learned combat skills, tracking, or even a magical connection to the cosmos through the necessity of surviving the hunts. Instead, you might have learned from the comrades you now consider family.</p>
			<p>What fuels you? Is it a visceral hatred of the beasts that slaughtered your loved ones? Or is it a reflection of your desire to stop these monsters'devastation, committing yourself to reining in their carnage? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in annihilating the scourge of beasts, or a significant change? What made you join a band of adventurers? Do you enjoy the break from the hunt that new allies provide, or do you find it difficult to teach them the jaeger ways?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a jaeger quickly by following these guidelines. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Constitution, and then Intelligence. Second, pick a background, preferably one that involves the city of Luyarnha.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 1st level, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one, and you can reload weapons with the loading, reload, or barrel properties without a free hand.</p>
			<p>Additionally, if you are carrying a one-handed melee weapon in one hand, and a one-handed ranged weapon in the other, you do not have disadvantage from being within 5 feet of a hostile creature on attacks made with that ranged weapon.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, your concentration during battle is razor sharp, letting you keenly focus during critical moments. You have 1 Focus Point. You gain additional Focus Points at 2nd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level, as shown on the Jaeger table. You can expend Focus Points to use Focus Arts. You learn two such Focus Arts: Weapon Parry and Dodge Step. You learn one additional Focus Art of your choice at 2nd, 7th, 13th, and 17th level. Your Focus Art options are detailed at the end of the class description.</p>
			<p>When you roll a 20 on a saving throw or attack roll against a hostile creature, you regain 1 expended Focus Point. You regain all expended Focus Points when you finish a short or long rest. When you roll initiative and have no Focus Points remaining, you regain 1 Focus Point.</p>

			<h5 class="caption">WEAPON PARRY</h5>
			<p><i>Focus Art, Reaction</i></p>
			<p>As a reaction to being hit by a creature you can see within range of a weapon you are holding, you can expend 1 Focus Point to make a special weapon attack against that creature. This attack does no damage, but instead blocks an amount of damage from the incoming attack equal to the weapon's damage roll (include ability modifier), unless your attack roll is a 1. On a 20, any weapon damage dice are doubled (like a critical hit would be) and if this total fully blocks the incoming attack, the target is stunned until the start of its next turn.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">DODGE STEP</h5>
			<p><i>Focus Art, Reaction</i></p>
			<p>As a reaction to being attacked by a creature you can see, if your speed is not 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to move 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks and make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the attacker's attack roll (including modifiers). On a success, you evade completely and take no damage. On a failure, you halve the attack's damage against you.</p>

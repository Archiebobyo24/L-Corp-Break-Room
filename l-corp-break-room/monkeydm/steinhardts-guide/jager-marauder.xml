			<p>A jaeger of this Chapter embodies raw slaughter. Vengeance, wrath, and death, all rolled into one swing that never ceases, endlessly scything through monsters, leaving a bloody wake of destruction. Each marauder is a symbol of the Chapter's determination and ferocity, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies with every swing of their weapon. They are unstoppable warriors, driven by a thirst for vengeance and the need to protect humanity from the monstrous hordes.</p>

			<p>When you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon with the two-handed property, you can expend all of your Momentum dice. When you do so, the attack deals additional damage equal to 1 Momentum die, and cleaves a number of adjacent targets within reach equal to the number of dice expended. Make a melee weapon attack against each creature targeted. You regain 1 Focus Point for each creature this reduces to 0 hit points, up to your maximum number of Focus Points.</p>

			<p>Also at 3rd level, while you are wielding a melee weapon with the two-handed property, the size of your Momentum die is increased by one step (from a d6 to a d8, to a d10 at 11th level, and to a d12 at 17th level).</p>
            <p>Additionally, while you are wearing medium armor, you can add your Constitution modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier (to a maximum of +2) when calculating your AC.</p>

			<p>At 7th level, once per turn, if you move more than 15 feet toward a creature (or fall 10 feet or more) immediately before making a weapon attack against them, you deal additional damage on a hit equal to your Momentum Die.</p>
            <p>When falling, you can make this attack prior to hitting the ground if there is a target creature in range where you would fall. On a hit, any falling damage you take is reduced by half, and you do not fall prone from the fall.</p>

			<p>Starting at 17th level, your strength is so great that you can wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, and can use two-weapon fighting even when the weapons you are wielding aren't light (including using two-handed weapons).</p>
            <p>If you choose to use two hands to wield a two-handed weapon, when you roll damage with it, you deal bonus damage equal to half your Strength modifier (rounded up).</p>
            <p>Additionally, when you use a Finisher, you can use your full titanic power to treat it as if it had twice as many Momentum dice, up to a number equal to your maximum Momentum dice + 1. Once you use this, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
